### REFERENCE ###
Here's a stepbystep description of these paradigms:Utilize VR to create simulated environments that mimic realworld physical tasks.

### UNCONSTRAINED ###
These methodologies employ virtual reality to construct artificial settings that replicate activities requiring physical exertion.

### CONSTRAINED ###
The process involves using virtual reality technology to develop simulated environments that closely replicate realworld physical tasks, allowing users to interact with digital representations of actual scenarios.

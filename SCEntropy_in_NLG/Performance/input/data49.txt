### REFERENCE ###
Here's the stepbystep process:Researchers develop organoids or cell cultures that represent specific human tissues, such as liver, kidney, or heart.

### UNCONSTRAINED ###
Scientists create miniature tissue models, like those of hepatic, renal, or cardiac origin, using cultured cells or organoids in a sequential methodology.

### CONSTRAINED ###
Scientists engineer organoids or in vitro cell cultures to model distinct human tissues, including hepatic, renal, and cardiac structures.

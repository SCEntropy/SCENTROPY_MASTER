### REFERENCE ###
Implement thermal management techniques such as heat sinks, fans, or phasechange materials to maintain optimal operating temperatures, as high temperatures can increase energy consumption.

### UNCONSTRAINED ###
Employ cooling methods like heat exchangers, blowers, or materials that alter state to preserve ideal working conditions, since elevated heat levels may lead to greater power usage.

### CONSTRAINED ###
To maintain optimal operating temperatures and prevent increased energy consumption caused by high temperatures, it is essential to implement thermal management techniques like heat sinks, fans, or phasechange materials.

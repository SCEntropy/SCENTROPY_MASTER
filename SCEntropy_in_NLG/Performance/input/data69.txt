### REFERENCE ###
Integrate the harmonic suppression system into the EV's production line or retrofit it into existing vehicles.

### UNCONSTRAINED ###
Implement the system for reducing harmonics either during the assembly of electric vehicles or by adding it to those already manufactured.

### CONSTRAINED ###
The harmonic suppression system should be seamlessly incorporated into the electric vehicle's production line during manufacturing or alternatively adapted and installed into vehicles that are already in use.
